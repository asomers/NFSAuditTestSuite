TEST CASES FOR NFS AUDIT

1. What and How should I export folder for NFS sharing? Currently, SERVER: 192.168.56.105 and EXPORT: /usr/shivank/home/audit_TEST_NFS, I wish to make it more generic and without affecting exports(5).
using 127.0.0.1 as SERVER leads to permission denied error in mkdir.
2. undo the changes made by the RPC. For example, removing the directory or regular file.
	(a.) I use the remove("/mnt/audit_TEST_NFS/fileforaudit") call in cleanup part. Is it the right way?
3. difference b/w ATF_CHECK_EQ and ATF_REQUIRE_EQ?
4. TODO: replace all if () ... exit(10) with ATF_CHECK_EQ/ATF_REQUIRE_EQ
