TEST CASES FOR NFS AUDIT

1. What and How should I export folder for NFS sharing? Currently, SERVER: 192.168.56.105 and EXPORT: /usr/shivank/home/audit_TEST_NFS, I wish to make it more generic and without affecting exports(5).
using 127.0.0.1 as SERVER leads to permission denied error in mkdir.
2. How to exports the subdirectory in Kyua generated temp folder. Currently, I hardcode path values /etc/exports and same with ATF TEST CASE. Exporting the server directory through the ATF program will be more good.
3. Reduce code duplicacy while writing test body. Looking for some way to do it. Currently thinking of defining a macro to do the same.
