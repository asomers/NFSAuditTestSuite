Current status: 42/42 Test Case pass
TEST CASES FOR NFS AUDIT

XXX: while running the AuditTestSuite, nothing appears in `praudit /dev/auditpipe` but rpc logs appear while running NFSAuditTestSuite, and bugs issue due to this. Probably, some issue while setting up audit, Unable to debug as all conditions pass, and code exactly similar to AuditTestSuite.

XXX: I was not able to supply a nfsfh to rpc_nfs3_readlink_async for symlink. So, I used high level api nfs_readlink to test the nfsrvd_readlink.

My Current Test Design:
	a.) I assume the RPC executes successfully. (i.e. the status == RPC_STATUS_SUCCESS). If not, the test case fails.
	b.) Now, when the RPC have been executed. The RPC result status may be NFS3_OK or some error. NFS3_OK indicates the RPC have successfully done its work. For instance, if the directoy already exists in mkdir case, the status rpc_cb will be RPC_STATUS_SUCCESS and (MKDIR3res *)res->status will not be NFS3_OK and some error.

XXX: There was an issue that some test case fail due to an error during nfs_mount.
After some debugging, I found out it was when nfsd service isn't already running and started by our testprogram. Adding a delay{sleep(0.5)} solved the bug. Is there any better way to implement this?

*DONE*
DONE (adding a delay before in tc_body_init solved this too)- Ist record(after system rebooted) fail to appear in the audit trail. This lead to failure of first test case always(on first run after start) as it can't regex match in record string

DONE -What and How should I export folder for NFS sharing? Currently, SERVER: 192.168.56.105 and EXPORT: /usr/shivank/home/audit_TEST_NFS, I wish to make it more generic and without affecting exports(5). -SOLVED Now it exports kyua temp subdirectory on 127.1 home
DONE: vnode locking issues exists with NFS audit code. I checked it with libnfs/tests while auditd running.
DONE -How to exports the subdirectory in Kyua generated temp folder. Currently, I hardcode path values /etc/exports and same with ATF TEST CASE. Exporting the server directory through the ATF program will be more good.
DONE -Reduce code duplicacy while writing test body. Looking for some way to do it. Currently I defiined a helper function which do the job pretty good.
DONE -Problems with the design described in Point 4. I'm unable to find the failure cases with res != NFS3_OK. (like case of getattr) - SOLVED
