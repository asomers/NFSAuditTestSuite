TEST CASES FOR NFS AUDIT

DONE -What and How should I export folder for NFS sharing? Currently, SERVER: 192.168.56.105 and EXPORT: /usr/shivank/home/audit_TEST_NFS, I wish to make it more generic and without affecting exports(5). -SOLVED Now it exports kyua temp subdirectory on 127.1 home

DONE -How to exports the subdirectory in Kyua generated temp folder. Currently, I hardcode path values /etc/exports and same with ATF TEST CASE. Exporting the server directory through the ATF program will be more good.
DONE -Reduce code duplicacy while writing test body. Looking for some way to do it. Currently I defiined a helper function which do the job pretty good.
4. My Current Test Design:
	a.) I assume the RPC executes successfully. (i.e. the status == RPC_STATUS_SUCCESS). If not, the test case fails.
	b.) Now, when the RPC have been executed. The RPC result status may be NFS3_OK or some error. NFS3_OK indicates the RPC have successfully done its work. For instance, if the directoy already exists in mkdir case, the status rpc_cb will be RPC_STATUS_SUCCESS and (MKDIR3res *)res->status will not be NFS3_OK and some error.
	c.) For the success scenarios, the above testing is clear and simple. But In case of failure, we can fail the RPC in many ways. Should I also include the case where RPC fails (possibly due to invalid arguemnts and result in RPC_STATUS_ERROR)?
DONE -Problems with the design described in Point 4. I'm unable to find the failure cases with res != NFS3_OK. (like case of getattr) - SOLVED
